  "readme": "Lottie for React Native, [iOS](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios), and [Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android)\n===\n\n[![npm Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/lottie-react-native.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react-native) [![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/lottie-react-native.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react-native) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/lottie-react-native.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/lottie-react-native)\n\nLottie component for React Native (iOS and Android)\n\nLottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as JSON with [bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) and renders them natively on mobile!\n\nFor the first time, designers can create **and ship** beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand. They say a picture is worth 1,000 words so here are 13,000:\n\n![Example1](docs/gifs/Example1.gif)\n\n\n![Example2](docs/gifs/Example2.gif)\n\n\n![Example3](docs/gifs/Example3.gif)\n\n\n![Community](docs/gifs/Community%202_3.gif)\n\n\n![Example4](docs/gifs/Example4.gif)\n\n\nAll of these animations were created in After Effects, exported with bodymovin, and rendered natively with no additional engineering effort.\n\n\n## Related Projects\n\nThis project is only the code to wrap and expose Lottie to React Native. The parsing/rendering code can be found in their\nrespective libraries:\n\n[Lottie for iOS](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios)\n\n[Lottie for Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nGet started with Lottie by installing the node module:\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save lottie-react-native\n```\n\nIf you're using CocoaPods on iOS, you can put the following in your `Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\npod 'lottie-ios', :path => '../node_modules/lottie-ios'\npod 'lottie-react-native', :path => '../node_modules/lottie-react-native'\n```\n\nIf you're not using CocoaPods on iOS, you can use `react-native link`:\n\n```bash\nreact-native link lottie-ios\nreact-native link lottie-react-native\n```\n\nFor android, you can  `react-native link` as well:\n\n```bash\nreact-native link lottie-react-native\n```\n\nLottie requires Android support library version 25. If you're using the `react-native init` template,\nyou may still be using 23. To change this, simply go to `android/app/build.gradle` and find the\n`compileSdkVersion` option inside of the `android` block and change it to\n\n```\nandroid {\n    compileSdkVersion 25 // <-- update this to 25\n    // ...\n```\n\nWith this change you should be ready to go.\n\nPlease file an issue if you have any trouble!\n\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n[See full component API](/docs/api.md)\n\nLottie's animation progress can be controlled with an `Animated` value:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Animated } from 'react-native';\nimport Animation from 'lottie-react-native';\n\nexport default class BasicExample extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      progress: new Animated.Value(0),\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    Animated.timing(this.state.progress, {\n      toValue: 1,\n      duration: 5000,\n    }).start();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Animation\n        style={{\n          width: 200,\n          height: 200,\n        }}\n        source={require('../path/to/animation.json')}\n        progress={this.state.progress}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, there is an imperative API which is sometimes simpler.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Animation from 'lottie-react-native';\n\nexport default class BasicExample extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.animation.play();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Animation\n        ref={animation => { this.animation = animation; }}\n        style={{\n          width: 200,\n          height: 200,\n        }}\n        source={require('../path/to/animation.json')}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Running the Example Project\n\nYou can check out the example project with the following instructions\n\n1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-react-native.git`\n2. Open: `cd lottie-react-native` and Install: `npm install`\n3. Run `npm start` to start the packager.\n4. In another CLI window, do the following:\n\nFor Running iOS:\n\n1. If you don't have CocoaPods installed, run `bundle install`\n2. Install pods: `npm run build:pods`\n3. Run Example: `npm run run:ios`\n\nFor Running Android:\n\n1. Run Example: `npm run run:android`\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you are trying to run `pod install` and you get:\n\n```\n[!] Unable to find a specification for `lottie-ios`\n```\n\nRun `pod repo update` and retry.\n\n\n## Supported / Unsupported After Effects features\n\nPlease find this information on the [iOS](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios#supported-after-effects-features) and [Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android#supported-after-effects-features) repositories.\n\n\n## Alternatives\n\n1. Build animations by hand. Building animations by hand is a huge time commitment for design and engineering across Android and iOS. It's often hard or even impossible to justify spending so much time to get an animation right.\n2. [Facebook Keyframes](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Keyframes). Keyframes is a wonderful new library from Facebook that they built for reactions. However, Keyframes doesn't support some of Lottie's features such as masks, mattes, trim paths, dash patterns, and more.\n2. Gifs. Gifs are more than double the size of a bodymovin JSON and are rendered at a fixed size that can't be scaled up to match large and high density screens.\n3. Png sequences. Png sequences are even worse than gifs in that their file sizes are often 30-50x the size of the bodymovin json and also can't be scaled up.\n\n\n## Why is it called Lottie?\n\nLottie is named after a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation. Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) – the oldest surviving feature-length animated film, preceding Walt Disney's feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) by over ten years\n[The art of Lotte Reineger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvU55CUw5Ck&feature=youtu.be)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [Contributors Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n## License\n\n[Apache-2.0](/LICENSE.md)\n",
